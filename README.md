# Simple Weather App

A simple weather app that displays the weather of the user's city of choice. The user can enter their city of choice or, they can click 'Locate Me' button that locates the user's location and displays the weather in the user's location.


The app uses **NodeJS** and **express** for the backend. As for the frontend, the app uses **ejs** as the templating engine. Weather data retrieved from [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
